To write a comment that will be hidden from the code chunk in rendered document, you need to use comment-directives. And the syntax of the comment directive depends on the language of the code chunk and therefore, should start with the character(s) that is used to do inline commenting in that programming language.

So for python, R and Julia, it should start with hash or pound symbol `#`. For javascript or ojs or dot chunk, it should start with `//`, for mermaid graph chunk it should start with `%%`. It is because, after all, they should be valid comment line when the document parses.

After deciding on the syntax of comment-directives, enlist them with or under the `comment-directive` yaml option. Then `hide-comment` filter will remove the lines from code chunk that initiates with the enlisted directives.

This demo uses

- `#>` comment-directive for R and Julia code chunk.
- `#?` comment-directive for python code chunk.
- `//>` for ojs and dot code chunk
- `%%>` for mermaid code chunk

## R code chunk

```{r}
#| message: false
#> This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
#> but not in rendered documents
library(dplyr) 

#>
#> more hidden comment
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, am ,vs) %>% 
  group_by(vs) %>% 
  summarise(mean(mpg))
```


## Python code chunk

```{python}
#? This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
#? but not in rendered documents
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```


## Julia code chunk

```{julia}
#| eval: false
#> This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
#> but not in rendered documents
using Plots

plot(sin, x->sin(2x), 0, 2Ï€, leg=false, fill=(0,:lavender))
```

## ojs code chunk

```{ojs}
//> This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
//> but not in rendered documents
viewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(
  [32, 50], 
  {value: 35, step: 1, label: "Bill length (min):"}
)
viewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"], 
  { value: ["Torgersen", "Biscoe"], 
    label: "Islands:"
  }
)
```


## dot code chunk

```{dot}
//> This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
//> but not in rendered documents
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
  runbl -- run;
  run -- kernel;
  kernel -- zombie;
  kernel -- sleep;
  kernel -- runmem;
  sleep -- swap;
  swap -- runswap;
  runswap -- new;
  runswap -- runmem;
  new -- runmem;
  sleep -- runmem;
}
```


## Mermaid code chunk

```{mermaid}
%%> This is some hidden comment which is visible in code editor
%%> but not in rendered documents
sequenceDiagram
  participant Alice
  participant Bob
  Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
  loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
  end
  Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
  John-->>Alice: Great!
  John->>Bob: How about you?
  Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
